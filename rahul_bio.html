        I bring over a decade of international research expertise to the table, with a strong track record in planning and executing social research initiatives.

          My primary focus within the realm of development advisory revolves around key areas such as financial inclusion, digital financial services, gender equality, women's economic empowerment, education, and poverty assessment. I excel in crafting research designs, developing research tools, designing evaluations, conducting data analysis, crafting comprehensive reports, shaping proposals, and creating knowledge products. With experience spanning ten diverse countries, I've concentrated much of my development advisory work in the South Asian region, including India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, as well as the Pacific Island Countries.
